Open Source Notes App
---------------------

A simple notes app. First goal is to have a running RESTfull server API, 
and an html frontend that supports google+ login, creating a todo-list, and sharing it.

If you get a git clone, and have mongodb running at localhost:27017,
currently you can:

> npm install
>
> npm test --coverage
>
> node app

Then browse to http://localhost:3001/ to see the google+ login, or browse to http://localhost:3001/docs to see the REST api.
