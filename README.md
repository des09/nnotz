Open Source Notes App
---------------------

A simple notes app. First goal is to have a running RESTfull server API, 
and an html frontend that supports google+ login, creating a todo-list, and sharing it.

Currently you can:

> clone,
>
> npm install
>
> node app

Then browse to http://localhost:3001/ to see the google+ login, or browse to http://localhost:3001/docs to see the REST api.
